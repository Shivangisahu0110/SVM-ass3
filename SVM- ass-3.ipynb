    "To evaluate the performance of your Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression model for predicting house prices based on characteristics such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., you typically want to choose a regression metric that is suitable for measuring the accuracy of continuous predictions. Here are some common regression metrics you can consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE is the average of the squared differences between predicted values and actual values. It penalizes large errors more than MAE (discussed next).\n",
    "Formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "                    n\n",
    "          MSE = 1/n ∑ (yi-yi^)^2\n",
    "                   i=1\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: It is widely used and emphasizes larger errors, which can be important in applications where large errors are particularly undesirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):\n",
    "\n",
    "MAE is the average of the absolute differences between predicted values and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "                    n\n",
    "          MAE = 1/n ∑ |yi-yi^|\n",
    "                   i=1\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: It is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE because it doesn't square the errors.\n",
    "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE is the square root of the MSE. It provides an interpretable scale as it is in the same units as the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "                           n\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage: It is directly interpretable in the context of the target variable, which can be helpful for understanding the magnitude of the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given your task of predicting house prices, where the goal is to minimize the difference between predicted and actual prices, Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) would typically be the most appropriate metrics to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute these metrics:\n",

    "When your goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible with your SVM regression model, Mean Squared Error (MSE) would generally be more appropriate as the evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "## why MSE is preferable in this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Direct Measure of Accuracy: MSE directly measures the average squared difference between predicted house prices and actual house prices. Minimizing MSE means minimizing the average error in predicting prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Penalizes Larger Errors: MSE penalizes larger errors more than smaller errors due to the squaring operation. This is often desirable in pricing predictions where large prediction errors can have significant consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Commonly Used in Regression: MSE is one of the most commonly used metrics for regression tasks. It provides a straightforward measure of prediction accuracy that is easy to interpret — lower MSE indicates better predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, R-squared (Coefficient of Determination) is a relative measure of how well the predicted values compare to the variance in the actual values. While R-squared is useful for understanding the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model, it doesn't directly measure the accuracy of individual predictions in terms of absolute differences, which is crucial when your goal is to predict house prices as accurately as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for the specific goal of predicting house prices accurately, MSE is typically the preferred metric because it directly assesses prediction accuracy in terms of absolute errors, which aligns directly with the goal of minimizing discrepancies between predicted and actual prices."

    "When dealing with a dataset that contains a significant number of outliers, the most appropriate regression metric to use with your SVM model would be Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "## MAE is suitable for datasets with outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Robustness to Outliers: MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Outliers can disproportionately influence MSE and RMSE because they involve squaring the errors, which amplifies larger deviations from the predicted values. In contrast, MAE treats all errors equally regardless of their magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Focus on Absolute Deviations: MAE measures the average magnitude of errors without considering their direction (whether they are overpredictions or underpredictions). This can be advantageous when outliers might cause large but infrequent deviations from the predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interpretability: MAE is straightforward to interpret as it gives the average absolute error in the same units as the target variable (e.g., dollars in the case of house prices). This makes it easier to communicate the model’s performance in practical terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Application to SVM Regression: SVM regression models typically aim to find a hyperplane that minimizes the sum of absolute deviations from the predicted values to the actual values (in the case of epsilon-insensitive loss functions). Therefore, using MAE aligns well with the underlying optimization objective of SVM regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "While RMSE is also an option and provides a measure in the same units as the target variable, it is more sensitive to outliers due to the squaring of errors. In the presence of significant outliers, MAE generally provides a more robust and reliable assessment of prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) would be the most appropriate regression metric to use with your SVM model when your dataset has a significant number of outlier"

    "\n",
    "2. Directly Comparable to Target Variable: Since RMSE is the square root of MSE, it retains the beneficial properties of MSE (penalizing larger errors more) while also being easier to understand because it's on the same scale as the target variable.\n",

    "3. Common Usage: RMSE is a widely used metric in regression tasks, including those involving SVM models with polynomial kernels. Its popularity stems from its ability to provide a clear measure of the average magnitude of errors made by the model.\n",

    "\n",

    "3. Comparison Across Models: R-squared allows for direct comparison of different SVM regression models with various kernels. It helps in assessing which kernel configuration (linear, polynomial, RBF) performs better in terms of capturing the variance in the target variable.\n",
